# IDEO NY Visitors Website Frontend
This is a responsive PWA frontend for IDEO NY Visitors Website.

## Environment Variables
By convention, `.env` file used to inject environment variables at build time is ignored by `git`. Instead, an `.env.example` is checked-in and tracked. Prior to running this app in development or building it for production:

- `cp .env.example .env` to create the `.env` file from its template
- Edit `.env` and fill it with the correct values:
	- `REACT_APP_BASE_API_URL` is where the frontend discovers the backend service. If you're developing this app locally, strat your backend Strapi application (found at `../backend` and use the value `http://localhost:1337` for this environment variable.
	- `REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY` is used to authenticate this applicationb with Google to use for `OAuth`. To retrieve the appropriate value, contact the maintainer of this project at [mnilchiani@ideo.com](mailto:mnilchiani@ideo.com)
	- `REACT_APP_LS_AUTH_KEY` is the key used to store the `jwt` token retrieved from `OAuth` authentication process in localstorage. Use any value that makes sense for you.


## Available Scripts
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
